## 🎯 Judge Demo Script (2 Minutes)

### Opening (15 sec)
> "SchemeDesk is NOT a portal. It's an eligibility intelligence layer that sits on top of existing government infrastructure."

### Dashboard (30 sec)
> "Notice we don't say 'Welcome'. We show potential benefits you're missing - ₹2.5 lakhs. We show approval probability - MEDIUM. This is system intelligence, not cosmetic counters."

### Schemes (45 sec)
> "No '100% match' badges. We show rule coverage - 80%, 4 out of 5 rules matched. Approval risk - MEDIUM because income proof is pending. We show realistic signals - this scheme needs 5 documents, takes 45-60 days, and the top rejection reason is incomplete land records."

### Applications (30 sec)
> "We handle failures explicitly. See the verification flow stepper - 5 stages. Delay reason auto-generated. Missing documents flagged. Appeal eligibility shown. This is how a real decision system thinks."
